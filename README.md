DbAdmin drivers for MySQL
=========================

This package provides MySQL drivers for [Jaxon Adminer](https://github.com/lagdo/jaxon-adminer), and implements the interfaces defined in [https://github.com/lagdo/dbadmin-driver](https://github.com/lagdo/dbadmin-driver).

It requires either the `php-mysqli` or the `php-pdo_mysql` PHP extension to be installed, and uses the former by default.

This package is based on [Adminer](https://github.com/vrana/adminer).
